# Nightfire_SDK
Half-Life SDK and AMXModX, etc port to James Bond 007 Nightfire PC

NOTE: this is currently a work in progress and part of an overhaul

Only the game's executable (located in dedicated_client), metamod and amxmodx are currently ported

amxmodx is currently not compilable as it is being transitioned from using an older fork of metamod for nightfire

REQUIREMENTS: create environment variable in Windows called HLSDK and point it to the hlsdk directory create environment variable in Windows called METAMOD and point it to the metamod\metamod-hl1-master directory
