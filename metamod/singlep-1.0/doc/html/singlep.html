<title>Singleplayer support for Metamod</title>

<h1>Singlep plugin
</h1>

<p> This plugin incorporates code provided by <a href="http://www.racc-ai.com/">Pierre-Marie Baty</a> for using Metamod with
single-player Half-Life, which came from discussions with <a href="http://planethalflife.com/botman/">Botman</a> on running bots in
single-player Half-Life.

<h2>Use of singlep
</h2></a>

<p> Install it as you would a normal Metamod plugin, and it should solve the
problems otherwise seen when trying to run Metamod with single-player games
(savegames not working, game triggers not activating, etc).  For further
discussion, see <a href="#problem">below</a>.

<p> The plugin provides a single command ("splist") to print out the list
of function names and addresses, ie:

<pre>
	ActiveThink@CBaseTurret 92364368
	AngularMoveDone@CBaseToggle 92322784
	Animate@CBMortar 91866864
	Animate@CSquidSpit 91875856
	AnimateThink@CControllerZapBall 91933600
	AnimateThink@CSprite 91960848
	AnimateUntilDead@CSprite 91960928
</pre>

<p> Further discussion of the problem, from Pierre:

<blockquote>

Look at all the functions that are callable inside a game DLL (ie, Valve's
HL.DLL).  You'll note that you find :

<ul>
   <li>GetEntityAPI
   <li>GetEntityAPI2
   <li>GiveFnptrsToDll
   <li>the list of entities built by LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC (ammo_357, player,
       env_beam, etc.)
</ul>

OK, given that, if you can build a DLL that fakes those exports, you have a
"hook DLL", that is seen by the engine side as a valid GameDLL.  That's what
bot authors do.  That's what you are doing in metamod too.

<h4>The problem:</h4>

<i>The interfacing is not complete</i>.  With just the above, you are not
exporting enough functions.  You are missing 50% of the exported functions, ie:

<pre>
	?AccelerateThink@CApacheHVR@@AAEXXZ
	?ActiveThink@CBaseTurret@@QAEXXZ
	?AngularMoveDone@CBaseToggle@@QAEXXZ
	?Animate@CBMortar@@QAEXXZ
</pre>

OK, those functions are MS-style exports (starting with '?', containing
'@@' etc, would not compile under Unix), but <i>they are required for
single-player gaming</i>.  Not having them exported too is the cause of many
bizarre behaviours you see in-game when you play single-player MODs with a
hook DLL between your engine DLL and your MOD DLL.  For example, in
Half-Life, the barney at the end of the train ride (intro scene) won't come
to open your door.  In Opposing Force, the barrack's door will refuse to
open.  In Azure Sheep, you can't use eye scanners.  Everywhere, you can't
save a game correctly.  I assume that's because some entities have special
functions interacting on them, that are "outside" their respective class
(the one interfaced to by the LINK_ENTITY_TO stuff).  For example, I've
found that the entity "func_tracktrain" must also react to calls to
"?DeadEnd@CFuncTrackTrain@@QAEXXZ" for functioning correctly in
single-player.  How and why is that stuff implemented in the genuine DLLs,
I dunno &amp; I don't give a ****.  But that is.

<h4>My solution (which is basically the same as botman's)</h4>:

When the engine and your hook DLL are exchanging the list of their
functions, they build a table associating each function to an address in
memory.  Then, when the engine needs (or is asked for) a function, knowing
its name, it calls it directly at the right adress.  But since you are not
exporting half the functions, the table is very incomplete.  <i>Instead of
letting the engine look in its array for a function it obviously won't
find, I am doing the work for it</i>.  When the hook DLL loads the game DLL
using LoadLibrary, I get told what DLL file it is.  So I open it, and build
myself my own exports--address table.  I look for each export, and store 1)
its address, and 2) its name (without the MS C++ -style mangled case
because the engine usually calls these functions by pure alphanumeric
names).  And so, when the engine asks for a function address or a function
name of the game DLL using <a
href="http://metamod.org/engine_notes.html#FunctionFromName">FUNCTION_FROM_NAME()</a> or <a
href="http://metamod.org/engine_notes.html#NameForFunction">NAME_FOR_FUNCTION()</a>, instead
of letting those macros do the work, I feed it with my own addresses and my
own names.  Then the engine looks up at these addresses and finds the
functions it expects to find.  It doesn't know, and doesn't need to, that
these functions in memory are located outside the segment where my hook DLL
is actually loaded, actually <i>instead of finding these functions inside
the fake DLL that it believes to be the game DLL, it goes and find it
directly in the right game DLL</i>, because I told it the function it
requested was located at such an address.  If I'd let FunctionFromName()
and NameForFunction() work, it would never find those functions since the
hook DLL doesn't export them.  And such a trick makes the thing work,
because the interfacing is now fully realized.
